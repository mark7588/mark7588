## Introdcution
Hi, I am currently working as a data engineer in Wells Fargo (33rd Company in F500, Top 3 bank in the US). I focus on ETL pipeline maintenance and migration projects. I am currently learning DevOps through OpenShift Container Platform migration project. Outside work, I am working on LLMs, Agentic AI workflows, ML model knowledge. I am pursuing master degree in Computer Science at UT Austin. My current goal is pivoting from traditional data engineering to AI/ML Engineering. I have passion in ML model development from feature engineering, creating data pipeline to deployment of the model.
