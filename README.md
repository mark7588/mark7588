## Introdcution
Hi, I am currently working as a data engineer in Wells Fargo (33rd Company in F500, Top 3 bank in the US). I focus on ETL pipeline maintenance and migration projects. I am currently learning DevOps through OpenShift Container Platform migration project. Outside work, I am studying foundation knowledge in AI/ML and Python. I am pursuing master degree in Computer Science at UT Austin. My short term goal is to become a data scientist. I love visualizing and analyzing data to extract actionable knowledge from them. I am passionate about responsible and explainable AI. I am exploring to discover the most interesting area in AI/ML.
